      the dissolution of democracy, and significant emboldening of antisemites and white
      supremacists, it is our belief that sides need to be chosen. Progressive Pedals was
      born in an effort to motivate the type of social change that musicians have been at
      the forefront of for generations. A significant portion of every sale will be
      donated to various progressive causes, from the Trevor Project and Planned
      Parenthood to the ACLU.`,

      change is real. Billionaires want to enslave you. Class matters more than race,
      political belief, or sexuality. All indigenous groups have the right to self
      determine in their homeland. Love is love. Reproductive rights are human rights.
      Police exist to protect the interests of capital. Everyone deserves food, water, and
